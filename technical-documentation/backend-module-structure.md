![](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-from-2018-09-19-18-02-08.png)

To store the global data that is related to Auditor Portal, nested application named `purchase_order` was implemented.  
Views and serializers are still located in the parent application to keep the consistant place for all module logic.

The App consists of the following parts:  
- `migrations` - database migrations  
- `tests` - unit tests  
- `admin.py` - admin site config  
- `apps.py` - python app config  
- `models.py` - partner with their staff members  
- `synchronizer.py` - VISION partner synchronizer  
- `tasks.py` - periodic tasks, which are responsible for keeping the  partners synced with the VISION
