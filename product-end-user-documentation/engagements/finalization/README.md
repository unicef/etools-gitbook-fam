# How to finalize the engagement?

Finalization of the engagement is allowed for UNICEF Focal point who was created the engagement. See more details about user rights [here](../../overview/user-roles-and-permissions.md). 

The option is available for engagements with **"Report submitted"** status. 

The button **"Finalize"** is displayed in the bottom of the Status panel.
