# Adding Staff Spot Check

Adding the Staff Spot Check is similar to adding the engagement described in the [How to add the Engagement?](../engagements/how-to-add-new-engagement.md) article.

Here is the overall user interface:

The Engagement Overview section has differences: 

* The Vendor name filed is filled in by default and is non-editable for user.
* The Audit Staff Team Member section is filled with auditors linked to the UNICEF Staff organization.

Reporting by Auditor, modifying by UNICEF Focal Point, Finalizing the engagement is performed in the same way as for [Engagements section](../engagements/).
