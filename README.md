## Design Philosophy of FAM

The UX / visual design philosophy builds on [Google Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/), with variations.

## Technical design of FAM

The technical design philosophy for FAM builds on what has already been established by the eTools team at UNICEF. More information here: [https://github.com/unicef/etools](https://github.com/unicef/etools).
